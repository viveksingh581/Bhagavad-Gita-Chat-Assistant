## 🌟 Features

- Multilingual support (English, Hindi, Sanskrit)
- Context-aware responses using RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)
- High-performance indexing vector search using Qdrant with Binary Quantization and FastEmbed. 
- High-quality thinking and reasoning capability powered by the Deepseek-R1 model via Groq for faster response. 
- Retrieval pipeline using LlamaIndex core. 

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

- **LLM**: Deepseek-R1-distill-llama-70b (via Groq)
- **Vector Store**: Qdrant with Binary Quantization
- **Embeddings**: FastEmbed (Nlper GTE-large model)
- **Framework**: LlamaIndex Core

## 💡 Binary Quantization

This project leverages Qdrant's Binary Quantization (BQ) for optimal performance:

- **Performance Benefits**: 
  - Up to 40x improvement in retrieval speeds
  - Significantly reduced memory consumption
  - Excellent scalability for large vector dimensions

- **How it Works**: 
  - Converts floating point vector embeddings into binary/boolean values
  - Built on Qdrant's scalar quantization technology
  - Uses specialized SIMD CPU instructions for fast vector comparisons

- **Advantages**:
  - Handles high throughput requirements
  - Maintains low latency
  - Provides efficient indexing
  - Particularly effective for collections with large vector lengths

- **Flexibility**: 
  - Allows balancing between speed and recall accuracy at search time
  - No need to rebuild indices to adjust this tradeoff

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Groq API Key
- Qdrant Cloud Account (or local installation)
- Access to the Bhagavad Gita source documents

## ⚡ Installation

1. Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Set up environment variables:
```python
os.environ['GROQ_API_KEY'] = 'your-groq-api-key'
```

3. Configure Qdrant client with your credentials:
```python
client = qdrant_client.QdrantClient(
    url = "your-qdrant-url",
    api_key = "your-qdrant-api-key",
    prefer_grpc=True
)
```

## 🎯 Key Components

### Vector Store Configuration
- Uses Qdrant with binary quantization for efficient storage and retrieval
- Vector size: 1024 dimensions
- Distance metric: Cosine similarity
- On-disk storage with RAM optimization

### RAG Pipeline
1. **Retrieval**: Searches for relevant passages using semantic similarity
2. **Augmentation**: Combines retrieved context with the user query
3. **Generation**: Produces responses using the Deepseek-R1 model

## 📝 Notes

- The system uses batched processing (batch size: 50) for efficient document embedding
- Binary quantization optimizes both storage footprint and query performance
- The assistant is designed to acknowledge when it doesn't have sufficient context to answer a question
- Responses are grounded in the provided Bhagavad Gita text to ensure accuracy
